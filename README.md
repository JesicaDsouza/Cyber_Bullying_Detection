# MiniProject-Cyber_Bullying_Detection
  Cyberbullying is the act of humiliating, scaring, or causing danger to other people through electronic devices and online networks. Bullies, if left unquestioned of their behavior, can normalize such behavior leading to rampant abuse. 
  Automatic detection and cyberbullying reporting can help keep a check on individuals occupying online space and induce a sense of responsibility towards their behavior.
